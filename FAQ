Frequently asked questions (Q:) and answers (A:) for simple-cdd.

Q: the image I'm generating with simple-cdd is always giving me "no kernel
modules were found" 

A: this is likely a problem with debian-cd's debian-installer tasks specifying
an old kernel version.  to work around it, you may have to use a customized
debian-cd dir, or specify additional customzed "includes" in simple-cdd.conf


Q: i get warnings about 'cannot find md5sum.textutils'

A: your distribution probably no longer had md5sum.textutils, hopefully the
standard md5sum utility will work. 

edit debian-cd/Makefile:
md5sum=/usr/bin/md5sum


Q: how do i set up a custom debian-cd dir?

A: you simply need to copy the debian-cd dir to somewhere, and edit whatever
files you need to customize.  this will not be updated if you install a new
version of debian-cd- you will have to update your custom debian-cd directory
yourself.

cp -a /usr/share/debian-cd ~/my-debian-cd

in simple-cdd.conf:

debian_cd_dir="~/my-debian-cd"


Q: i get lot's of messages like this:
Link from /home/vagrant/simple-cdd/mirror//pool/main/l/links/links_0.99+1.00pre12-1_i386.deb to /home/vagrant/simple-cdd/tmp//sarge-i386/CD1/pool/main/l/links/links_0.99+1.00pre12-1_i386.deb failed: No such file or directory

A: not totally sure about these, but it's always been packages i didn't want or
need anyways, and hasn't caused me any trouble.  i think it *might* be because
debian-cd is trying to include all the packages from a particular source
package on the same CD, or certain packages on the first CD.


Q: can i default to using a MTA other than exim4, such as postfix?

A: you can include other MTAs on the CD, but by default, it is difficult to
avoid installing exim4. simply installing another MTA should remove exim4, so
if you include it in one of the profile's .packages, you should end up with the
MTA you want.
