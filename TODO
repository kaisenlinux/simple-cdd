update README (mostly done) and FAQ

make --local-packages handling a mirror-tools method

explore debian-installer's "auto" mode for use with simple-cdd

include debian-live images with live-helper

debian-installer network boot method (instead of CD)

explore using .disk/udeb_include instead of preseeding to load
simple-cdd-profiles udeb

build-simple-cdd:
  support arbitrary number of additional mirrors
  commandline options to:
    define working dir:
      profiles dir, simple-cdd.conf, checkpackages, etc
    point to profiles dir
    point to simple-cdd.conf
    add debconf preseed file
  set SECURITY even if do_mirror=false
    
dynamically tweak default.preseed 
  with a preseed/include, and add modifications to the included preseed
  directly

re-building with an existing debian-installer .iso
  see buildcd script from debian-edu (look for isoinfo):
    svn://svn.debian.org/svn/debian-edu/trunk/src/build/CD

write a debconf pre-seeding sanitizer:
  document questions that cause problems when preseeded:
    base-config    base-config/main-menu
    base-config    base-config/late_command
    base-config    base-config/early_command
    base-config    apt-setup/uri_type
    d-i    debconf/priority
    debconf       debconf/priority
    xserver-xfree86 (many hardware-specific ones)
